Lime Scooter and Bike use analysis in St. Paul, Minnesota

Lime scooters/bikes have made an appearance in St. Paul (and Minneapolis) in 2018 and while it seems like there is high demand, there isn't much information about how people have been using them.

This code collects Lime scooter and bike data over a period of time using the API and then analyzes how people are riding in St. Paul. Note that some of the code has been modified for security reasons.

Contents:
- .pynb Jupiter notebook with the code and documentation of the process I used to complete the analysis
- A "figures" folder which contains the google maps images that were generated from the code.
